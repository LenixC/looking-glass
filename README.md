# Looking Glass


Inspired by the looking glass from Prey (2017), this project uses FaceAPI to track your head movements and create the illusion of a space behind your monitor. As you move, the virtual space reacts.

### Features:

- Head Tracking: Monitors your head movements with FaceAPI.
- Interactive Space: Simulates a dynamic virtual environment behind your screen.

### License
